Wladek</p><p>- You had your papers on you. If you'd been hit by a bomb, they'd know where to take you.<br />- Henryk, don't<br />- Don't say things like that. God forbid, God forbid.</p><p>- We'll find somewhere else. We could walk in the park.<br />- No, we can't. It's an official decree. No Jews allowed in the park.<br />- My God, are you joking? I'm not joking.</p><p>- You!<br />- Up!<br />- Shh, Mama.<br />- What? Oh, my God. Shh.<br />- Oh, my God.</p><p>- What's happened? What? <br />- God. It's terrible. They're hunting people in the streets. They've taken Henryk.</p><p>- What happened here?<br />- They've got my grandson. They pick him up. They take him away.<br />- What do they do to them? I've stopped believing in God.</p><p>- And they're closing the small ghetto.<br />- My God.</p><p>- What did she do, for God's sake?<br />- She smothered her baby.</p><p>- My God. I haven't been outside in-- it must be two years.<br />- Don't get overexcited.</p><p>- My God, did they put up a fight.<br />- Yes, well,</p><p>- My God.</p><p>- 我不知道该怎么感谢你<br />- 谢谢上帝不用谢我<br />- 他让我们死里逃生<br />- 这就是为什么我们要信仰他</p>
